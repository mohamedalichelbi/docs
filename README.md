## What is Ref Finance?

**Ref Finance** is a collection of DeFi protocols powered by smart contracts on [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org) that enable trading, earning by providing liquidity and other financial use cases in the future.

Highlights:
 - Permission-less AMM pools for any NEAR's Fungible Tokens.
 - Trading across multiple pools in one transaction.
 - *1bps* referral fee on trading to pay the UI.
 - **Coming:** *4bps* exchange fee to split between $REF token holders.
 - **Coming v2:** constant weighted product AMM pool type.
 - **Coming v3:** combining AMM with an order book via limit orders.
 - **Coming v4:** lend / borrow.
 - **Coming in the distant future:** internal balances privacy: hide the balance of each user, removing ability to link two trades to the same user.
